This project uses Java (Java 21).
To run the application, you need to have Java 21 installed and then the application can be run from the main function in BustravelApplication.java. It is recommended to do that by running it from an IDE like IntelliJ, because Maven dependencies also need to be loaded in from pom.xml. 

In RouteData the username and password to access the assignments API also need to be changed (lines 31-32)
